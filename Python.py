# Python..................
# Python is the simple & easy 
# Free and open source
# High-level programming language
# Developed by Guido van Rossum
# Python is Interpreted language
# Python is Dynamically typed language
# Python is Object-Oriented language
# Python is Portable language
# Python is case-sensitive language




# Used for..............
# Web Development (Django, Flask)
# Data Science (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
# Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
# Artificial Intelligence
# Scripting
# Automation
# Game Development
# Desktop Application Development (Tkinter, PyQt)
# Network Programming
# Cybersecurity
# Internet of Things (IoT)
# Scientific Computing



# Python Character Set...............
# Letters (A-Z, a-z), 
# Digits (0-9), 
# Special Characters (like !, @, #, etc.), and 
# Whitespace characters (space, tab, newline).


# Variable Names in Python..............
# Varable is a name given to memory location to store data in program.
# varaible are changeable i.e we can change the value stored in variable.

# name = "Himanshu"
# age = 23
# price1 = 100


# Rules for naming variables in Python..............
# Identifiers can be a combination of letters, digits, and underscores
# Cannot start with a digit (0-9)
# cannot use special characters like !, @, #, $, %, etc.
# Identifiers are case-sensitive (e.g., myVar and myvar are different)
# Identifiers can be of any length


# Data Types in Python..............
# Data types are used to classify the type of data that a variable can hold.
# Common data types in Python include:
# int: Integer data type (e.g., 10, -5, 0)
# float: Floating-point data type (e.g., 10.5, -3.14)
# str: String data type (e.g., "Hello", 'Python')
# bool: Boolean data type (True or False)
# list: Ordered collection of items (e.g., [1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c'])
# tuple: Immutable ordered collection of items (e.g., (1, 2, 3), ('x', 'y', 'z'))
# dict: Key-value pairs (e.g., {'name': 'Himanshu', 'age': 23})
# set: Unordered collection of unique items (e.g., {1, 2, 3}, {'a', 'b', 'c'})
# type() function is used to know the data type of variable.
# none : Represents the absence of a value (NoneType)

# Keywords in Python.................
# Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.).
# Examples of keywords: False, None, True, and, as, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, nonlocal, not, or, pass, raise, return, try, while, with, yield


# Comments in Python.................
# Comments are used to explain the code and make it more readable.
# Single-line comments start with the # symbol.
# Multi-line comments can be created using triple quotes (''' or """).


# Operators in Python.................
# An operator is a special symbol that performs specific operations on one or more operands (values or variables).
# Types of operators:
# Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %, **, //
# Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
# Logical Operators: and, or, not
# Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=
# Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
# Membership Operators: in, not in
# Identity Operators: is, is not


# Type Conversion in Python.................
# Type conversion is the process of converting one data type to another.
# Implicit Type Conversion: Automatically done by Python.
# Explicit Type Conversion: Manually done by the programmer using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.
# Example of Explicit Type Conversion:
'''
num_str = "123"
num_int = int(num_str)
print("The string value:", num_str)
print("The integer value:", num_int)
print("Data type of num_str:", type(num_str))
print("Data type of num_int:", type(num_int))
'''

# Example of Implicit Type Conversion:

'''
num_int2 = 10
num_float = 5.5
result = num_int2 + num_float
print("The result of addition:", result)
print("Data type of result:", type(result))
'''


# Input in Python.................
# input() function is used to take input from the user.
# Example:
'''name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!") 
'''


# Output in Python.................
# print() function is used to display output to the user.
# Example:
'''age = 23
print("I am", age, "years old.") 
'''
